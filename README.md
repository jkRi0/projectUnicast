# UniEvent - UNICAST Event Planning System
Personalized event management system for finals project

UNICAST
-Unicast means sending messages to one person at a time, rather than broadcasting to everyone 
at once. It's like sending a personal invitation to someone rather than posting it on a group chat.
Example: Sending an invitation to a friend for a school play via email or SMS.

1. Event Planning & Scheduling
-Creating and organizing events with details
-A teacher/admin creates the event, sets a date, and adds details like time and location. Students 
and parents will receive personalized invitations.
Example: Teacher creates a science fair scheduled for next Friday. You receive an invitation to 
join.

2. Unicast Communication
-Sending personalized messages to individuals.
-When an event is created, each person (student/parent) gets a personal invitation. If you 
confirm your attendance, you get a reminder closer to the event.
Example: Teacher sends you a message asking if you will attend the science fair, and you 
confirm.

3. Attendance & Participation
-Tracking who confirms attendance.
-The system tracks who says they will come (RSVP). It sends reminders before the event and 
thanks you after.
Example: A day before the event, you get a reminder to attend, and after the event, a thank-you 
message.

4. Resource Management
-Managing resources required for the event.
-Example: You are asked to help set up a science experiment booth for the fair.

5. Event Feedback
-Collecting responses to improve future events.
-After the event, participants are asked to fill out a survey. This helps teachers improve future events.
Example: You fill out a survey after the science fair to give your feedback.
